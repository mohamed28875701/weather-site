# weather-site
This is weather site using html ,css and javascript using webpack as a bundler.I used the openweather api to get the need information on the site 
and i then displayed it using pure DOM manipulation with no extra html except the boilerplate and the content div.
I only encountered diffeculty in making the site responsive.
